Project title

This is my final project at the Data Analyst bootcamp Ironhack Barcelona, analysing the subject "Early leavers/ NEET in Europe, Spain and Barcelona".

Motivation
The idea comes from my personal background in teaching in vocational training as well as recent news reports aboit the Youth unemployment charta 2020 of the European Union.


Built with Jupyter
Libraries used: fbprophet

How to use?

It includes a profound analysis of the above mentioned subject, data wrangling, cleaning and visualization. As the data was to sparse and unclean in order to create a ML model, I used a prediction tool to forecast the evolution of % early leavers for Spain total and males.

Things to improve:

Some visualizations need improvement
More data on VET and recent OCDE surveys should be included
Contact may be made with education officials in order to achieve a data set with pupils observations in order to build a working ML model to predict school abandon.

Data used:

- Eurostat statistics
- OCDE survey
- Ministerio de Educación de España
- Ayuntament de Barcelona
